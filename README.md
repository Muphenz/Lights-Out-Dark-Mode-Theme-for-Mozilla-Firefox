<h1>Webpage Interface &#127760;</h1>

Please note that this theme exclusively modifies the appearance of the Firefox browser interface and does not alter the display of webpages. For a fully immersed dark mode experience, consider using it in conjunction with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/">Dark Reader</a> add-on.

<h1>Visuals &#128444;</h1>

As of now, Firefox doesn't support a gallery for themes, in contrast to add-ons. During this time, all photos will be hosted on GitHub.

<h1>Home Page Configuration &#9881;</h1>

Usually, you'll find the settings icon located on the home page.

![Settings Icon 1](https://github.com/Muphenz/Lights-Out-Dark-Mode-Theme-for-Mozilla-Firefox/assets/154757113/312ed8c4-9be4-4886-b3a8-cdb0d3b7aab5)

Yet, the settings icon won't be visible on the home page for this particular theme. 

![Settings Icon 2](https://github.com/Muphenz/Lights-Out-Dark-Mode-Theme-for-Mozilla-Firefox/assets/154757113/7a2d33ff-2335-4c40-a6bf-c64797597148)

Since the browser settings is conveniently accessible in the application menu (depicted by the triple lines icon â˜°), the settings icon on the home page was hidden to maintain a minimalistic design. The settings icon is still present. You'll spot the icon if you hover your mouse over it. However, the color was changed to blend in with the background to create the illusion that the icon was removed.

When home content is activated on the homepage, certain text elements may become obscure or invisible.

This occurs because Firefox allows altering the settings icon color on the home page only when the text color on the home page is also adjusted. Consequently, it's strongly advised to eliminate all content from the home page to achieve the minimalist aesthetic intended by this theme. 

<h3>Steps</h3>

I. Navigate to the application menu and proceed to the browser settings.

![Settings 1](https://github.com/Muphenz/Lights-Out-Dark-Mode-Theme-for-Mozilla-Firefox/assets/154757113/933cde03-b413-49cf-b4db-15727ece422e)

II. Select the home tab and then scroll down to the bottom of the page.

III. Choose Firefox home for both the home page and new tab in the drop-down menu. Then proceed to deselect web search, shortcuts, recommendations by Pocket, recent activity, and snippets.

Upon successfully executing all steps, your home page will boast a <a href="https://github.com/Muphenz/Lights-Out-Dark-Mode-Theme-for-Mozilla-Firefox/tree/main#home-page">sleek and minimalist design</a>.

<h1>Notifications &#x1F6A8;</h1>

The default Firefox theme features a blue download notification.

![Downloading 1](https://github.com/Muphenz/Lights-Out-Dark-Mode-Theme-for-Mozilla-Firefox/assets/154757113/50853f6c-3188-4901-b423-4cd73ca32f2d)

In this theme, deliberate adjustments were made to change the notification color to grey, aligning it with other icons. This frees users from the obligation to clear notifications every time a download occurs. Rest assured, you will still receive a notification flagged with a check mark when your download is complete.

Firefox themes are unable to customize the color of the update notification icon to integrate with this dark mode theme. This can only be achieved by injecting custom styling rules. As a result, the icon will remain in its original green color.
